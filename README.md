The purpose of this project is to download data from the Monthly International Trade Dataset (MITD) by using Census API.

To make more than 500 API calls a day, Census API requires users to sign up for an API Key. To get one, register [here](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

In this project, we'll be downloading 2-digit Harmonized System (HS) data. HS is an international classification system administered by the World Customs Organization.
